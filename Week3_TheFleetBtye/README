This exercise has 2 major goals:

 * Help you practice processing noisy data from sensors to extract more accurate estimates of 
variables of interest

 * Help you develop an understanding of how much work goes into extracting meaningful information 
from raw measurements on a realistic application

 Your goal:

 - Implement the sensor/signal processing components that recover a runner's position, velocity, 
direction, and heart rate from sensor measurements on a wrist-worn device (you may have something 
like that yourself!).

 - Think creatively about ways in which sensor measurements can be filtered, cleaned up, or 
combined in order to give you more reliable information

 - Get as close to the 'real' values of the relevant quantities as you can.

 The starter code comments describe all you need to do.

 There's only one script you need to modify: FleetByte.m - do not change Sim1.m in any way please!

 Also important: There is a 'pkg load'  instruction near the top that is only needed in Octave, if 
you're using Matlab please comment this out (or you'll get an error!)

 Submitting your work:

    Rename your script   FleetByte_teamname.m

    Submit right here on Quercus only once per team, thank you!

 As ever - talk with us if you have any questions, aren't quite sure how to proceed, or want to ask 
us about possible ways to solve this exercise.
